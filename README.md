<h1>Wordle Tracker</h1>

Wordle Tracker is just a fun little visualization of Wordle scores among friends in a slack group. Unfortunately, our consistency at Wordle leaves much to be desired but I still thought it would be cool to visualize this data over long time period.

<h2>Local Installation</h2>
To run the app locally, clone or fork the codebase to a local directory, install all npm dependencies in a bash terminal with <code>npm install</code> and start the app with <code>npm start</code>.
